ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Clone â€“ My HTML & CSS Journey
This project is my take on recreating the look and feel of YouTube only featuring with HTML and CSS.
Itâ€™s not just a clone â€“ itâ€™s my personal playground where I experimented with design, responsiveness, and some fun visual effects to make it feel alive. This project demonstrates responsive design using Flexbox and modern CSS styling.
